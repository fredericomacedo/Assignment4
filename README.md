This project is a sophisticated Java REST API application designed to illustrate CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations on a MySQL database, utilizing Hibernate for object-relational mapping and Java EE Security for secure and robust management of user authentication and authorization.

Technological Stack:
Java EE Security: To enforce robust security mechanisms, including user authentication and authorization.
Hibernate & JPA: Utilized for efficient object-relational mapping and to interact seamlessly with the MySQL database.
JUnit: Employed for writing and running comprehensive tests to ensure the applicationâ€™s reliability and stability.
EJB (Enterprise JavaBeans): For encapsulating the business logic and handling transaction management effectively.
Payara Server: Chosen as a runtime environment to deploy and manage the application.
Features:
Execution of seamless CRUD operations on the MySQL database.
Efficient interaction with the database using Hibernate and JPA.
Secure and robust user management utilizing Java EE Security.
Comprehensive testing with JUnit to ensure the reliability and stability of the application.
Effective encapsulation of business logic using EJB.
Deployment and management on Payara Server for optimal performance.
Purpose:
The primary goal of this application is to demonstrate how various Java technologies can be integrated to create a secure, reliable, and efficient REST API application that can perform CRUD operations on a MySQL database, serving as a valuable reference or starting point for developers working with similar technologies.

This description provides a clearer and more organized overview of your project, detailing its purpose, features, and the technologies used, which can help in understanding the scope and utility of the application.
